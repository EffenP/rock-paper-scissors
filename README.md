# The Odin Project Rock Paper scissors Assignment

Within this assignment i was tasked to create a function to play one round of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' which takes two parameters of 
the users picked move and the computers picked move. i created 2 helper functions to seperatly handle both the players and cpu's choice of move. The computers move was randomly chosen, and the player is prompted for an input which is validated to only take valid inputs. Eventually i will improve project by adding a GUI and more interactivity for the user.



Ideas:

-   give users choice of icons to play as
-   add sound effects for, button clicks

TODO:

General:
-   update and refactor function and class naming conventions
- make sure using camelCase

Start Menu:
- make start button bigger
- add title above the button
- add paragraph above button and below the title defining the rules of the game and the conditions for winning.

GameScreen:
-   add text to show the result of the playRound function so players know who won and if it was a tie
-   when player selects a card and the bg colour changes => reset the colour on a new round so players know the new round has begun
-   make font more readable
- improve the title looks

EndScreen:
-   move title further to the top 
- fix score readability (make bigger/adjust the font)

# The Odin Project Rock Paper scissors Assignment

Within this assignment i was tasked to create a function to play one round of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' which takes two parameters of 
the users picked move and the computers picked move. i created 2 helper functions to seperatly handle both the players and cpu's choice of move. The computers move was randomly chosen, and the player is prompted for an input which is validated to only take valid inputs. Eventually i will improve project by adding a GUI and more interactivity for the user.






TODO:

- if players draw -> replay the round untill a winner is found
- add a games played counter and output at the end

- Create a V3 adding a GUI.
